1) Run the project (It will create the database and apply migrations)
2) Go to "Data > DB.sql". Run that to populate the database tables with the folder/file hierachy.
3) Create a folder in you file system "C:\filestore" and place the files found in "Files.zip".
4) Switch between branches "blocking" and "messaging" to see the results of deleting a folder.
5) Start this repo 😉.
